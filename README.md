# DsuFlash


## Overview

This project implements a college information chatbot using Python and Flask. The chatbot provides users with instant access to information such as course fees, hostel facilities, campus infrastructure, location, application links, and contact details. It is designed to enhance user experience by offering 24/7 assistance and streamlining information retrieval processes.

## Features

- **Information Retrieval**: Fetches data on course fees, hostel details, infrastructure, and more from JSON files.
- **External Links**: Provides links to the college's online application form and official website.
- **Error Handling**: Manages errors gracefully and provides meaningful feedback to users.
